## Expectations

-   Github actions should pass for all tests
-   Each function should have a robust set of tests with at least three `expect` statements (excluding the render functions which can simply check `outerHTML`).
-   Each `expect` statement should have a third argument describing the specific thing being tested with this expect statement.
